# nas_backgrounds

I use this script to fetch the latest backgrounds posted on /r/WidescreenWallpaper.  The results are checked against my current images and what's in my ignore-list.txt -- any fetched images that I don't currently have or hasn't been added to the ignore-list are then downloaded.  

My Synology NAS only supports Node.js v 12, so JS is written with that in mind.
